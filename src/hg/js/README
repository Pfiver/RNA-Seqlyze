The js directory should hold all refereenced javascript files for normal browser CGIs.

The contents includes the versions of jQuery package files mostly unmodified by UCSC, 
as well as several that are specific tothe browser.  Files should be named for the 
CGI or the library that uses them:
   hgTracks.js  included by hgTracks CGI.
   hui.js       included by hui.c library code.
   utils.js     common utilities included by multiple CGIs.

The "make alpha" command should place all *.js files in apache/htdocs/js/",
while "make" will places js files in apache/htdocs/js/{user}/.

In order to avoid caching errors by client browsers, the CGIs reference these files by
a symlink that contains the timestamp of the file.  The symlink is created by the CGIs if
not found.

IMPORTANT:
In for a user to test changes to javascript files on a named browser a setting must be 
added to the hg.conf file of that browser.  For example for the browser "hgwdev-larrym",
the following line must appear in apache/cgi-bin-larrym/hg.conf
   browser.javaScriptDir=js/larrym

This will allow the CGIs to find the js files that "make" copies into place.
