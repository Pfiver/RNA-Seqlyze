<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
The Wiki track displays genome annotations added by the Genome Browser user 
community. 
These annotations have <B><em>not</em></B> been curated.

<H3>Adding an annotation</H3>
<P>
To add or edit an annotation in this track, you must first 
<A HREF="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Main_Page"
TARGET=_blank>create a login</A> on the UCSC Genome Browser
<A HREF="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/" TARGET=_blank>genomewiki</A>.  
You can then attach or update a notation to a UCSC gene or a genomic location.
</P>
<P>
<B>Annotating a UCSC gene:</B> To add or update an annotation for a UCSC gene, 
open the UCSC Genes track in the 
Genome Browser to your gene of interest, then click on the gene to display its 
information page.
Click <em>Sequence and Links</em>, then click <em>User annotations</em>
within the &quot;Sequence and Links to Tools and Databases&quot; section. 
If you have not logged in to the genomewiki, you will be prompted to do
so. If no annotation exists for the selected gene, the Genome Browser will 
display a text entry form for adding a new annotation. If notes have already
been added for the gene, the browser will display the corresponding 
genomewiki page, which may be edited using the genomewiki editor. 
</P>
Once an annotation has been added for a gene, it will display 
in the Genome Browser Wiki track in the coordinate range corresponding to the
gene locus identified by the annotated gene symbol. If additional loci are
associated with the gene symbol, the annotation will appear in the 
positions corresponding to these loci as well.
</P>
<P>
<B>Annotating a genomic location:</B> In addition to annotating specific genes, 
notes can be added to genome 
locations by clicking on the red bar at the top of the Wiki track.  By
default, the annotated position will correspond to the coordinate range of
the current Genome Browser view.
</P>
<P>
Initial annotations for a specific gene or position are created in a simple 
text entry form. The text is submitted to the genomewiki system
for archival storage.  The notes are tagged with a date/time stamp
and the creator's wiki login name.  Subsequent notes or corrections to
existing notes may be added by editing the wiki page for the annotation using
the Wiki editing system.
</P>

<H3>Policies</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The UCSC Genome Browser group reserves the right to remove any annotations.
<LI>Annotations are not curated by UCSC. Individuals with areas of expertise
	are welcome and encouraged to monitor annotations of interest and
	add notes of correction as appropriate.  Use the page watch
	function in the genomewiki to monitor changes to annotations.
<LI>The individual who creates the initial annotation is the &quot;owner&quot; 
of the annotation.
<LI>Annotation &quot;owners&quot;" have deletion privileges.
<LI>Deletion merely removes an item from the Wiki track display in the Genome
Browser. The actual annotation still exists in the genomewiki system,
	with an attached note that it has been deleted.
<LI>Annotations are enabled currently only on the human hg18 (March 2006) and
	mouse mm9 (July 2007) Genome Browsers.
