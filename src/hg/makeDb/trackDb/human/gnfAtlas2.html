<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows expression data from the GNF Gene Expression
Atlas 2. This contains two replicates each of 79 human
tissues run over Affymetrix microarrays. 
By default, averages of related tissues are shown.  Display all tissues
by selecting &quot;All Arrays&quot; from the &quot;Combine arrays&quot; menu
on the track settings page.
As is standard with microarray data red indicates overexpression in the 
tissue, and green indicates underexpression.   You may want to view gene
expression with the Gene Sorter as well as the Genome Browser.</P>
