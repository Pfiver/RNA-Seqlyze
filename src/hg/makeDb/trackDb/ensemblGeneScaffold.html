<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the mapping of Ensembl gene scaffold coordinates onto
the underlying assembly contigs or scaffolds.  Items are displayed in black 
and gray.  Gray items indicate segments of the gene scaffold that do not map 
in linear order to the underlying contig or scaffold.
</P>
<P>
These gene scaffolds were generated by <A HREF="http://www.ensembl.org" TARGET=_blank>Ensembl</A>.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This track is created from the Ensembl MySQL tables: <em>assembly.txt</em>
and <em>seq_region.txt</em>.
