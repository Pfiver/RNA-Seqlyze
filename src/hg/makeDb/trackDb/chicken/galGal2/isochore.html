<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the locations of isochores (regions of homogeneous GC 
content) in the $organism assembly.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Isochores are represented by rectangular blocks. Features with higher scores
are more darkly shaded.</P>
<P>
To display only those items that exceed a specific unnormalized score, enter
a minimum score between 0 and 1000 in the text box at the top of the track 
description page.
