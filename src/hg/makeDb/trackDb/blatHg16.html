<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays alignments of the $o_date $o_organism genome vs.
the $organism genome.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were made with blat in translated protein mode using the 
parameters <em>-q=dnax</em> <em>-t=dnax</em>.  The default settings were 
used otherwise. Both genomes were masked with 
<A HREF="http://www.repeatmasker.org" TARGET=_blank>RepeatMasker</A> and 
Tandem Repeat Finder before running blat.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was generated at UCSC.
