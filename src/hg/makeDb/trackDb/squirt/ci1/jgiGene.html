<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains alignments of predicted transcripts from the 
<A HREF="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ciona/" TARGET=_BLANK>DOE Joint Genome 
Institute</A> (JGI) to the <em>$organism</em> genome.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction 
tracks</A>.</P>
<P>
The track description page offers the following filter and configuration
options:
<UL>
<LI><B>Color track by codons:</B> Select the <em>genomic codons</em> option
to color and label each codon in a zoomed-in display to facilitate validation 
and comparison of gene predictions. Click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">Help on codon coloring</A>
link on the track description page for more information about this feature.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Predicted peptides from JGI were aligned to their predicted transcripts using 
the blat program to establish the coding portion of the transcript. The 
transcripts were then aligned to the <em>$organism</em> genome using blat.
For more information about this assembly and an analysis of the euchromatic
regions of the genome, see Dehal, P. <em>et al.</em> (2002) in the References 
section below.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The <em>$organism</em> predicted transcripts and peptides were provided by 
<A HREF="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/ciona/" TARGET=_BLANK>JGI</A>.  
Blat was written by Jim Kent. </P>
