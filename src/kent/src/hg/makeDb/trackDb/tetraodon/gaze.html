<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows Genoscope gene model annotations from the 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/analysis/GAZE/" TARGET=_blank>GAZE</A> program written by Kevin Howe.  These annotations were computed using GAZE 
with a custom designed gene model. GAZE integrates information from Geneid, 
Genscan, Exofish (Human, Mouse and Fugu), Genewise (Human and Mouse) and 
Tetraodon cDNAs.

For a description of the GAZE program and the model that underlies it, refer

<P>
GAZE was run on masked Tetraodon genomic DNA using parameters calibrated for 
the Tetraodon genome.
