<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This track shows the number of 25-mers in the genome that
are the same as the 25-mer centered at the current position 
with up to two mismatches allowed.  The current position is
included.  This track is empty over areas masked by RepeatMasker
or trf at period 12 or less.  It is best to design microarray
probes and PCR primers where the count in this track is only
one to avoid cross-hybridization.</P>

<P>For best results view this track with Interpolation set to Only Samples.</P>

This track was computed with the program 'olly' at the default settings.
