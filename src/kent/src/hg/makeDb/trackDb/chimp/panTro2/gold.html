<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the contigs and clones comprising the 
chimpanzee Build 2, Version 1 (Oct. 2005) 
assembly provided by the Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Consortium. 
For assembly details, see the chimpanzee  Jan. 2006 (panTro2)

<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the 
fragments (contigs and finished clones) used to create the assembled chromosomes. 
Contig and clone boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown
coloration. Where gaps exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and
brown blocks. Relative order and orientation, as determined from the human/chimp alignments,
is implied for the non-random chromosomes.
<P>
The fragment types within this track are:
<UL>
<LI><B>F</B> - Finished
<LI><B>A</B> - In Active Finishing 
<LI><B>D</B> - Draft 
<LI><B>W</B> - Whole Genome Shotgun contig
</UL>
