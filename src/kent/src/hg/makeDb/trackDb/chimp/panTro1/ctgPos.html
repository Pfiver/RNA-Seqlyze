<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the 
November 2003 Arachne $organism assembly (NCBI Build 1 Version 1) from the Chimp
Genome Sequencing Consortium.
<P>
The Arachne assembly of sequence to whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs and the 
mapping of the contigs to scaffolds (supercontigs) were performed at the 
Broad Institute.  To build this assembly, a &quot;modified de novo&quot; (MDN) 
assembly was created first, using the human genome to 
determine &mdash; among other things &mdash; that particular inserts were not chimeric. 
A separate &quot;validated
chimp-on-human&quot; (VCH) assembly was created by taking the chimp reads that align
uniquely to human, forming them into contigs via this alignment, and then removing
those contigs that failed a two-haplotype consistency check. Shared reads were then
used to align the two assemblies to one another. In positions where the sequence
was consistent, it was transferred from the VCH to the MDN assembly, further 
enriching the latter. Two global misassemblies were manually removed from the
merged assembly. This final assembly comprises the Build 1 Version 1 draft
release.
</P>
<P>
The Arachne assembly is composed of 361,782 contigs with an N50 length of 15.7 kb.
The total contig length is 2.73 Gb, spanning 3.02 Gb. 
The assembly contains 37,849 supercontigs
(scaffolds) having an N50 length of 8.6 Mb (not including gaps).
