<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the locations of $organism contigs on the physical map. 
The underlying data is derived from the NCBI <em>seq_contig.md</em> file 
that accompanies this assembly. All contigs are &quot;+&quot; oriented in
the assembly.</P>

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
For $organism genome reference sequences dated April 2003 and later,
the individual chromosome sequencing centers are responsible
for preparing the assembly of their chromosomes in 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/datorg.html">AGP</A> format. The
files provided by these centers are checked and validated at NCBI, and
form the basis for the <em>seq_contig.md</em> file that defines the physical 
map contigs.</P>
