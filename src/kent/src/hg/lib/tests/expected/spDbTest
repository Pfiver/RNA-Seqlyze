All comments:
 Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathway. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Activates the ADP-ribosyltransferase (exoS) activity of bacterial origin.
 Homodimer. Interacts with BSPRY, MLLT7/FOXO4, PCTK1 and SSH1. Binds to the C-terminal part of WEE1 (By similarity).
 Cytoplasm. Melanosome (By similarity).
 Isoform delta differs from isoform zeta in being phosphorylated (By similarity).
 Belongs to the 14-3-3 family.
