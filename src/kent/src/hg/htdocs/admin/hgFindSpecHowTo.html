<H2>Introduction</H2>

When a user types a search term into the position box in hgTracks or
hgTables, the search is performed by kent/src/hg/lib/hgFind.c's
findGenomePos() or findGenomePosWeb().  The set of tables to be
searched and the methods for searching each table used to be hardcoded 
into hgFind.c.  Since the spring of '04, the trackDb.ra files now 
define the set of tables to be searched, the order of search, and 
the method of searching each table.  
The goal of these changes is to allow developers to add or change 
searches by making small edits to the trackDb.ra files instead of 
large edits (with much copy-paste-modify code) to hgFind.c.  

<P>
When you run a <TT>make update</TT> in kent/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/, the 
<A HREF="#hgFindSpec"><TT>hgFindSpec</TT> program</A> 
is invoked to read search specifications 
from the trackDb.ra files and to create an 
<A HREF="#Fields">hgFindSpec_$USER table</A> in 
each database.  <TT>make alpha</TT> causes an hgFindSpec table to be 
created in each database.  This parallels the generation of trackDb_$USER 
and trackDb tables from the same trackDb.ra files and the same make 
targets.  
<P>

<P>
This document assumes familiarity with trackDb and the kent/src/hg/ tree, 
and describes how to go about adding a new search to a 
trackDb.ra file.  It also contains a bit of reference info about 
the new table and programs, including a diagnostic program 
<A HREF="#checkHgFindSpec"><TT>checkHgFindSpec</TT></A> 
which helps test the searches.  
</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="CreateSearch"></A>
<H2>How to create a search</H2>

<A NAME="searchTable"></A>
<H3>1. Identify the table(s) and field(s) to search.</H3>

Usually, you'll have just added a track, and you'll want to make a 
search on the names or IDs from the track table.  So you'll start like 
this:

<TT><PRE>
searchTable mySpiffyTrack
</PRE></TT>

<A NAME="xrefTable"></A>
<P>
In more complicated cases, you might have nice names in a
non-positional table (e.g. stsAlias) which you would like to make
searchable by cross-referencing them to a positional/track table 
(e.g. stsMap).  In that case, you'll need to add a line to 
identify the cross-referencing table:
</P>
<TT><PRE>
xrefTable mySpiffyAlias
</PRE></TT>

<A NAME="searchName"></A>
<P>
If there is already a search defined for your table, but you want to
add another, then you will have to make up a different searchName to
distinguish the two searches (by default, searchName = searchTable;
searchTable does not have to be unique among searches, but searchName
does):
</P>
<TT><PRE>
searchName mySpiffyTrackSpecial
searchTable mySpiffyTrack
</PRE></TT>


<A NAME="searchType"></A>
<A NAME="query"></A>
<H3>2. What is the type (or query format) of the table(s)?</H3>

If the main positional/track table for the search is a common type
such as genePred, bed or psl, then you can just declare a searchType 
and hgFind will know how to write the query for the table:

<TT><PRE>
searchType bed
</PRE></TT>

Some tables/searches already have special search code written for them, 
so you can name them as the searchType (but you usually won't have to 
write new descriptions for them since most are in the top-level trackDb.ra):
<UL>
    <LI>knownGene</LI>
    <LI>refGene</LI>
    <LI>cytoBand</LI>
    <LI>gold</LI>
    <LI>mrnaAcc</LI>
    <LI>mrnaKeyword</LI>
    <LI>sgdGene</LI>
</UL>

If your table is not one of the common or special-code table types,
then you'll have to write a SQL query to return the chrom, start, end
and name of items matching a given search term like this:

<A NAME="queryFormat"></A>
<TT><PRE>
query select myChrom, myChromStart, myChromEnd, myName from %s where myName like '%s'
</PRE></TT>

<A NAME="searchMethod"></A>
<P>
If you want your query format to end with <TT>'%s%%'</TT> (so that a search 
term of "hox" will result in a query on <TT>'hox%'</TT>), then 
add this line to your search spec:
</P>
<TT><PRE>
searchMethod prefix
</PRE></TT>

Similarly, if you want to use <TT>'%%%s%%'</TT> (=> <TT>'%hox%'</TT>), 
add this:

<TT><PRE>
searchMethod fuzzy
</PRE></TT>

The default searchMethod is exact (<TT>'%s'</TT>).  
If you don't write your own query, then hgFindSpec will use searchMethod 
to pick an ending for the default query for searchType.  
If you write your own query and don't have an xrefTable/xrefQuery, 
then your query must end with a pattern that's consistent with searchMethod.  

<A NAME="xrefQuery"></A>
<P>
If you have defined an xrefTable above, then you will definitely have
to define an xrefQuery for it.  Here's what that will look like:
</P>

<A NAME="xrefQueryFormat"></A>
<TT><PRE>
xrefQuery select trackName, searchName from %s where searchName like '%s'
</PRE></TT>

Use <TT>searchMethod prefix</TT> or <TT>searchMethod fuzzy</TT> if 
that's what you want for xrefQuery.  If you define an xrefQuery, then 
searchMethod applies to xrefQuery only, not query, and query has to be 
an exact search.  


<A NAME="termRegex"></A>
<H3>3. Define a regular expression for search terms</H3>

Often, the names that you're searching will follow a pattern, and 
we can exploit that to save a little time when searching.  
For example, if you're adding a search for a track where every 
name starts with "NT_" and then has 6 numbers, then we know that 
this track should be searched only when the user has typed in a 
search term that follows the same pattern.  If the user types in 
"HOX", then there is no point in searching through names composed of 
"NT_" plus 6 numbers.  So we add this line to the search spec:

<TT><PRE>
termRegex NT_[0-9]{6}
</PRE></TT>

<P>
Ultimately, the pattern we're looking for is in the user's search
terms that should be applied to our table -- this is <em>almost</em>
always the same as the pattern of the names in the table.  
(Exceptions: when the user types in a prefix that is not found in 
the table's names, e.g. "HG-U95:", or when the user omits a suffix 
that is found in the table's names.)  
</P>

<P>
Human beings are pretty good at recognizing patterns in names.  
We've even written little languages to describe text patterns as 
"regular expressions", or regexes, which are easy for computers 
to parse and then evaluate on arbitrary input (like users' search 
terms).  
hgFindSpec's termRegex field uses the regular expression language 
<TT>regex</TT>.  If you have used egrep before, you already know 
regex.  If you have used fancy glob commands, you have a good 
headstart.  If you use Perl regexps a lot, you are spoiled but 
regex will be straightforward enough.  
</P>

<P>
One way to learn <TT>regex</TT> is by example:
</P>

<UL>
    <LI><TT>[NX]M_[0-9]+</TT>: An N or an X, then an "M_", then at least 
       one number.
    </LI>
    <LI><TT>[a-z][a-z0-9][0-9]+</TT>: A letter (lowercase, but hgFind 
       does case-insensitive regex search), then a letter or a number, 
       then at least one number.  
    </LI>
    <LI><TT>(RP|CT|GS)[[:alnum:]]+-[[:alnum:]]+</TT>: 
       Either RP, CT, or GS; then some alphanumeric character(s); then 
       a hyphen; then some alphanumeric character(s).  
    </LI>
    <LI><TT>[^[:space:]]</TT>: Anything that is not a space (or tab or 
       newline).  This will match single-word queries (but not multi-word 
       because hgFindSpec adds "^" at the beginning and "$" at the end 
       of termRegexes, so that they are forced to match the entire search 
       term).  
    </LI>
    <LI><TT>A\.chr.*-.*\.[0-9]+</TT>: An A; a . (backslash-escaped because 
       otherwise it would mean "any character"); chr; anything up to a hypen;
       anything up to a . and some number(s).  
    </LI>
    <LI><TT>(x|y|[1-9][0-9]?)(p|q)[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?</TT>: 
       An x, y or one- or two-digit number; a p or q; some number(s); 
       an optional .number suffix.
    </LI>
</UL>

You can refer to man pages for regex syntax and for the C routines used 
to parse and execute regex searches:
<TT><PRE>
man 7 regex
man regex
</PRE></TT>

There are also numerous references on regex out there, e.g.
<A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/regex/regex_toc.html" TARGET=_BLANK>
http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/regex/regex_toc.html</A>... 
wow, looks like there's even a GUI wizard/coach:
<A HREF="http://www.weitz.de/regex-coach/" TARGET=_BLANK>
http://www.weitz.de/regex-coach/</A>.  
And you can always ask an old UNIX-head like me for help.  

<P>
Here's my favorite way to define a termRegex, and make sure that it
really covers all the names in a table:

<TT><PRE>
hgsql $db -N -e "select name from $table limit 10"
</PRE></TT>

<A NAME="egrep"></A>
<P>
Eyeball the results and write a regex.  Then try out that regex in
this command (substitute it in for <TT>__TERMREGEX__</TT>):
</P>
<TT><PRE>
hgsql $db -N -e "select name from $table" | egrep -vi '^__TERMREGEX__$' | head
</PRE></TT>

If that returns any results, then your regex needs to be loosened up
to incorporate those.  Keep on playing with the regex and running that
command until it comes back clean - there's your termRegex*!  

<P>
*In those rare cases mentioned above when the user types in something
a little different from what's in the table, use the regex you just
derived as the <A HREF="#dontCheck">dontCheck</A> setting, 
so <TT>checkHgFindSpec -checkTermRegex</TT>
won't complain.  Write a termRegex to match what the user types in.  
Do some extra testing to make sure that your termRegex encompasses all user 
search terms that should match.  


<A NAME="shortCircuit"></A>
<H3>4. When is a shortCircuit a good thing?</H3>

Some search terms are easily identified as accessions.  Returning to
our example of "NT_" and 6 numbers, we can be fairly certain that the
user wants the NCBI physical map contig for that accession.  
So if we find a match for such a search term in the ctgPos table,
we're done!  No need to search other tables, even if their regexes are
loose enough to accept the accession (for example, the mrnaKeyword or
knownGene searches will take anything, but they also take a long
time).

<P>
If we have a nice clear-cut case like that, we can make it a
shortCircuit search:

<TT><PRE>
shortCircuit 1
</PRE></TT>

... but be extra-sure that terms found there won't have interesting
matches anywhere else.  For example, the snpMap table contains a bunch
of IDs that start with rs and end with one or more digits.  But there
is a gene rs10, so we don't want to shortCircuit because then the user
couldn't search for that gene -- they'd be zapped to the SNP whether
they wanted it or not.  So we define two searches for snpMap: one that
shortCircuits for rs followed by a bunch of numbers (unambiguously a
SNP ID), and one that doesn't shortCircuit but searches for rs
followed by a small number of numbers.
</P>

<P>
hgFind performs shortCircuit searches first, stopping if it gets a 
match.  If no shortCircuit search produces a match, then hgFind 
performs all other (additive/non-shortCircuit) searches.  
</P>

<A NAME="semiShortCircuit"></A>
<P>
A slight twist to this mechanism is the semiShortCircuit setting:

<TT><PRE>
semiShortCircuit 1
</PRE></TT>

That allows other shortCircuit or semiShortCircuit searches to be 
performed even if a match is found for this search, and is for use 
when we need the speed but are not absolutely sure that this track 
contains the only correct result for the search term.
</P>


<A NAME="searchPriority"></A>
<H3>5. Decide on a searchPriority</H3>

hgFindSpec.searchPriority, like trackDb.priority, is a relative thing.  
Run this command to see the order in which tables are searched in $db:

<TT><PRE>
checkHgFindSpec $db
</PRE></TT>

Figure out where your search should fit in (this is not nearly as 
important as whether it's shortCircuit or not!  but ask an old-timer 
if you're having trouble deciding).  For additive/non-short-circuit 
searches, if there are a bunch of matches from various tracks, in 
what order should those tracks' matches be presented to the user?  

<P>
Then look at the searchPriorities of the searches between which your 
search should fit, and pick a (floating-point) number between those 
two numbers.
</P>

<TT><PRE>
searchPriority 42
</PRE></TT>


<H3>6. Test!</H3>
First do a "make update" so that the hgFindSpec program will process 
your trackDb.ra definition into the hgFindSpec table in each applicable 
database:
<TT><PRE>
cd kent/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb
make update DBS=$db1 ZOO_DBS=

# or if your search applies to more than one db
make update DBS="$db1 $db2" ZOO_DBS=
</PRE></TT>
hgFindSpec can catch some problems with search definitions, such as
missing fields or improperly formatted queries or termRegexes.  

<P>
Next, use the <TT><A HREF="#checkHgFindSpec">checkHgFindSpec</A></TT> utility
to try out an example search and see if there are any incomplete 
termRegexes.

<TT><PRE>
checkHgFindSpec $db $exampleTerm
checkHgFindSpec -checkTermRegex
</PRE></TT>
<P>
Then open up a browser window on hgwdev-$USER and try a bunch of examples.
If it looks OK, check in your trackDb.ra changes, go to a clean updated 
tree, and do a "make alpha" in kent/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/ .
</P>


<HR>
<A NAME="SpecialCase"></A>
<H2>Some special cases</H2>

<A NAME="termPrefix"></A>
<A NAME="dontCheck"></A>
<H3>User search terms not exactly the same as names in table</H3>
<P>
Sometimes the search terms that users type in are not quite the same as 
the name values in the tables to be searched.  For example, for our 
affy* tracks, we tell users to prefix probe IDs with chip IDs, but the 
affy* tables contain just probe IDs.  So the user may type in 
"HG-U95:1003_s_at", but the item name in the affyU95 table is just 
"1003_s_at".  To tell hgFind (and <TT>checkHgFindSpec -checkTermRegex</TT>) 
that search terms (and termRegex) have a prefix that does not appear in 
the table, add a line like this to the trackDb.ra search spec:
</P>
<TT><PRE>
termPrefix HG-U95:
</PRE></TT>

<P>
For all other cases where user search terms (and therefore termRegex) 
don't match the actual values in the table, or are a subset of the 
actual values in the table, add a line like this with a regex that 
will cover the table values not covered by termRegex, so that 
<TT>checkHgFindSpec -checkTermRegex</TT> doesn't flag it as an error:
</P>
<TT><PRE>
dontCheck [[:alnum:]]+\.[0-9]+
</PRE></TT>

<A NAME="padding"></A>
<H3>Adding padding</H3>
For small features such as STS markers or SNPs, we often want to display 
the larger genomic context of the requested feature.  If that is the case 
for your search, add a line like this to the trackDb.ra search spec:
<TT><PRE>
padding 5000
</PRE></TT>
That will cause 5000 to be subtracted from the start and added to the end 
of search results (unless the user has entered multiple search terms 
separated by ";" in order to get the range between them).  


<A NAME="searchBoth"></A>
<H3>xrefTable names may overlap searchTable names</H3>

An xrefTable may relate totally distinct types of names/IDs, such as
gene names to accessions.  However, in the case of alias tables, there
may be some names that are found both in the searchTable and in the
xrefTable.  Undesirable duplicate results can arise when performing
separate searches on searchTable alone and on searchTable via
xrefTable.  If that's the case, the xref search can be made to also
search for the term in searchTable (instead of giving up if xrefTable
doesn't contain the search term) by adding this to the trackDb.ra 
search spec:
<TT><PRE>
searchBoth 1
</PRE></TT>

<A NAME="searchDescription"></A>
<H3>Alternate description for table/search in HTML for multiple results</H3>

When there are multiple results for a search term, hgFind outputs HTML 
with the various choices organized by the searches that produced them, 
with links to the browser.  By default, the description of the search is 
the searchTable name plus its trackDb.longLabel value (if any).  If you 
want something different (e.g. if you want to make it clear that this 
was an xref search), add a line like this to the trackDb.ra search spec:

<TT><PRE>
searchDescription Alias of STS Marker
</PRE></TT>



<HR>
<A NAME="Fields"></A>
<H2>hgFindSpec (the table) fields and settings</H2>

Both proper fields of hgFindSpec and optional settings appear in
trackDb.ra search specs, one per line.  Settings are for search
parameters that are rarely used, or that were added after
hgFindSpec.as was frozen.

<P>
Here's the kent/src/hg/lib/hgFindSpec.as description of the fields:
</P>
<TT><PRE>

    string <A HREF="#searchMethod">searchMethod</A>;	"Type of search (exact, prefix, fuzzy)."
    string <A HREF="#searchType">searchType</A>;		"Type of search (bed, genePred, knownGene etc)."
    ubyte <A HREF="#shortCircuit">shortCircuit</A>;		"If nonzero, and there is a result from this search, jump to the result instead of performing other searches."
    string <A HREF="#termRegex">termRegex</A>;		"Regular expression (see man 7 regex) to eval on search term: if it matches, perform search query."
    string <A HREF="#query">query</A>;		"sprintf format string for SQL query on a given table and value."
    string <A HREF="#xrefTable">xrefTable</A>;		"If search is xref, perform xrefQuery on search term, then query with that result."
    string <A HREF="#xrefQuery">xrefQuery</A>;		"sprintf format string for SQL query on a given (xref) table and value."
    float <A HREF="#searchPriority">searchPriority</A>;	"0-1000 - relative order/importance of this search.  0 is top."
    string <A HREF="#searchDescription">searchDescription</A>;	"Description of table/search (default: trackDb.{longLabel,tableName})"
</PRE></TT>

<P>
Here is a description of currently supported settings:
</P>
<UL>
    <LI><TT><A HREF="#dontCheck">dontCheck</A></TT>: 
        a regex for <TT>checkHgFindSpec -checkTermRegex</TT> to use 
	in place of termRegex.  This is for those cases when the termRegex 
	(for user search terms) does not encompass all items to be searched 
	in searchTable.
    </LI>
    <LI><TT><A HREF="#padding">padding</A></TT>: 
        an integer to pad the results range with, i.e. to subtract
        from the start and add to the end (unless the user has entered

        range between them).
    </LI>
    <LI><TT><A HREF="#searchBoth">searchBoth</A></TT>: 
        if non-null (present in the trackDb.ra spec), and the spec has

	xrefTable, then look for the search term in searchTable too.
    </LI>
    <LI><TT><A HREF="#termPrefix">termPrefix</A></TT>: 
        a string found at the beginning of the user's search term (and

<H2><TT>checkHgFindSpec</TT> and how to use it</H2>

<TT>checkHgFindSpec</TT> is a diagnostic program for examining the
order of search, testing searches from the command line, and looking
for possible problems with search specs.  You need a ~/.hg.conf file 
in order to run it.  If ~/.hg.conf specifies trackDb_$USER as your 
trackDb table, then the hgFindSpec_$USER table will be examined.  

<TT><PRE>
  checkHgFindSpec database [options | termToSearch]
If given a termToSearch, displays the list of tables that will be searched
and how long it took to figure that out; then performs the search and the
time it took.

<HR>
<A NAME="hgFindSpec"></A>
<H2><TT>hgFindSpec</TT> (the program)</H2>

In general, you won't have to run hgFindSpec on the command line; 
<TT>make update</TT> or <TT>make alpha</TT> in kent/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/ 
will do the right thing.  However, hgFindSpec does check for several 
error conditions in trackDb.ra search specs, which you'll need to 
know about so you can fix them if you ever come across them:

<UL>
<LI>
<TT>
hfsPolish: search %s: termRegex "%s" got regular expression compilation error ...
</TT>: this implies a regular expression syntax problem in 
<A HREF="#termRegex">termRegex</A>.  Unfortunately the 
error description from regerror() is not always very clear.  In particular 
it won't always point out simple things like unbalanced parentheses.  
Try the <A HREF="#egrep">egrep</A> command trick given above... 
if it works in egrep, it should work in hgFindSpec.  
</LI>

<LI>
<TT>
hfsPolish: search %s: query needs to be of the format ...
</TT>: hgFindSpec is very picky about the format of the 
<A HREF="#queryFormat">query</A> 
(and <A HREF="#xrefQueryFormat">xrefQuery</A>). 
It actually uses a regex to make sure your 
<A HREF="#query">query/xrefQuery</A> looks just as 
expected, and is consistent with the <A HREF="#searchMethod">searchMethod</A> 
(exact, prefix, or fuzzy; exact is the default).  
</LI>

<LI>
<TT>
hfsPolish: search %s: there is an xrefQuery so query needs to end with ...
</TT>: If your search has an 
<A HREF="#xrefTable">xrefTable</A>/<A HREF="#xrefQuery">xrefQuery</A>, 
then the <A HREF="#searchMethod">searchMethod</A> applies to your xrefQuery.  
<A HREF="#query">query</A> must be exact.  
</LI>

<LI>
<TT>hfsPolish: search %s: searchMethod is fuzzy so query needs to end with %s.
</TT>: This type of message is what you'll see if 
<A HREF="#searchMethod">searchMethod</A> is inconsistent 
with your <A HREF="#query">query's (or xrefQuery's)</A> ending.  
searchMethod exact => <TT>'%s'</TT>, 
prefix => <TT>'%s%%'</TT>,
fuzzy => <TT>'%%%s%%'</TT>.
</LI>

<LI>
<TT>hfsPolish: search %s: if searchType is not defined, then query must be defined.
</TT>: A default query is provided for recognized 
<A HREF="#searchType">searchType</A>s.  If a 
searchType isn't specified, then you have to write a suitable 
<A HREF="#queryFormat">query</A>.  
</LI>

<LI>
