<P>
Region definitions are ordinary 3- or 4-field bed file format.  For example:
</P>
<PRE>
#  comment lines can be included starting with the # symbol
chrX   151073054   151173000
chrX   151183000   151190000  optionalRegionName
chrX   151283000   151290000
chrX   151383000   151390000
</PRE>

<P>
There is a limit of 1,000 defined regions.  Using the upload
file function will replace any existing regions.  The fourth
field, name, is optional and for notation purposes only, it is
not used in the table browser.  These are 0-relative coordinates,
first base on a chromosome is 0.
</P>
<P>
Coordinates can also be entered in the form:
<PRE>
chrX:151,283,001-151,290,000  optionalRegionName
</PRE>
These are 1-relative coordinates, first base on a chromosome is 1.
</P>
