	abstract = {Genome-wide studies of bacterial gene expression are shifting from microarray technology to second generation sequencing platforms. {RNA-seq} has a number of advantages over hybridization-based techniques, such as annotation-independent detection of transcription, improved sensitivity and increased dynamic range. Early studies have uncovered a wealth of novel coding sequences and non-coding {RNA}, and are revealing a transcriptional landscape that increasingly mirrors that of eukaryotes. Already basic {RNA-seq} protocols have been improved and adapted to looking at particular aspects of {RNA} biology, often with an emphasis on non-coding {RNAs}, and further refinements to current techniques will improve our understanding of gene expression, and genome content, in the future.},

 genomes. Many sets of genes occur in the same order on multiple

 This study describes a computational method to estimate the likelihood

 to analyze 34 bacterial and archaeal genomes, and yielded more than
 7600 pairs of genes that are highly likely {(P} ≥ 0.98) to belong to the same operon. The
 sensitivity of our method is 30-50\% for the Escherichia coli genome. The predicted gene pairs are
 available from our World Wide Web site http://www.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/operons/operons.cgi.},
